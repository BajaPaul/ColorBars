# ColorBars

This C# UWP App is intended for multi-monitor configurations.  App displays SMPTE type color bars.  Display can be stretched across multiple monitors.  User can then adjust monitor settings via hardware buttons and/or software settings so display appears consistent across all monitors.

The display can be reversed and/or rotated allowing comparison of image on one monitor to adjacent monitor.  Double-tap a color bar and its color will expand to fill display.  Double-tap expanded color to return to previous color bar display.  Color bar label position can be toggled Left, Center, Right, or Off, as desired.

This App requires library file LibMainPageCommon.cs located in Library-Files-for-other-Repository-Apps to be linked under folder named 'Library' to compile.

I no longer intend to support this App so placing code on GitHub so others can use if useful.
